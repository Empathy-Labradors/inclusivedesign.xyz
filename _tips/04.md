title: No mouse, no trackpad
why: People with physical impairments use a keyboard instead of a mouse as it doesnâ€™t require precise movements.

## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- Browse your site using only your keyboard: use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to navigate forwards and backwards on the page.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Can you see where you are on the page? Look for a visible :focus indicator as you navigate using the `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` keys.
- Can you interact with every element on the page?
- Can you use functionality (like tooltips) that you usually see on a hover action?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use HTML elements like `buttons` and (`a href`) links instead of `divs` and `spans`. These automagically receive focus.
- Use distinct, clear, `:focus` styles in your CSS. A change in background color and an outline are a good idea.
