## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Does the order that the content is read out in make sense? Note any issues.
- Does image `alt` text that’s read out make sense? Does it convey the same information as the image?
- Are the correct HTML elements are used for navigation, lists, headings, and so on?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use correct headings and HTML structure to make your site navigable.
- Make sure important calls to action contain text - not just images.
- Use descriptive image `alt` tags.
- Keep decorative images and irrelevant, hidden content silent in screen readers.
