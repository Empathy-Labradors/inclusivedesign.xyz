## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- **Windows:** Ctrl + (Control and plus)
- **Mac OS:** âŒ˜ + (Command and plus)
- Look in the View menu of your browser for Zoom In/Out shortcuts.


## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Is there any unreadable or missing content?
- Does your content reflow gracefully?
- Is all functionality still there?
- Are all elements resized, including widgets?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use fluid units like `ems` and `%` instead of fixed ones like `px`.
- Use a bigger base `font-size`.  `100%` is a good minimum.
