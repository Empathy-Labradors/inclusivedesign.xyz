## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- Use {% include link id=2 %} to translate any content (e.g. headings or paragraphs) on your site into another language (Xhosa is a good choice for this).
  - Just copy and paste the text from your site into Google Translate.
- Translate the result back into English.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Is all content in plain, clear, language?
- Is all content suitable for a low literacy level?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Keep content short, clear, and simple: use headings, bullets and simple sentences.
- Replace jargon and overly technical terms.
- Make button and link text descriptive. It should describe what happens when you use the button or follow the link.
- Use images to break up content and to provide alternatives to text information.
