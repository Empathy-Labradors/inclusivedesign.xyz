title: Brightness
why: People with visual disabilities need information that has sufficient contrast. Anyone can have issues with brightness due to context or environmental factors, for example being outside on a sunny day, or using a device with an old or low quality screen.

## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- **Chrome:** Start **Sunshine Sue** in {% include link id=3 %}.
Set the intensity of the simulation to about 5.
- Browse your site.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Are all paragraphs, headings, icons and images visible and readable?
- Has content disappeared?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use a bigger base `font-size`. `100%` is a good minimum.
- Make sure text has good foreground/background contrast. See {% include link id=4 %}. A ratio of 4.5:1 gives you WCAG AA compliance ("you're doing great for Web Content Accessibility") and 7:1 for WCAG AAA compliance ("you're doing amazing for Web Content Accessibility!")
