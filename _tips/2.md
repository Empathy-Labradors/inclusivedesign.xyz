## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- Disable stylesheets (CSS) so that you just see the content (the HTML) on your site.
  - Chrome: install the Web Developer extension (bit.ly/emplab046). Select CSS > Disable All Styles.
  - Firefox: View menu > Page Style > No Style.
  - Safari: Enable the Develop menu: Preferences > Advanced > check “Show Develop menu in menu bar”. Then Develop menu > Disable Styles.
  - IE / Edge: Page > Style > No Styles.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

Is the content and the navigation clear and consistent?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Change the order of your content for a clearer, more consistent reading experience and flow: use a linear, logical order.
- Update styles so that they don’t make the visual order very different from the content order.
- Use headers (h1 to h6 elements). People use them like a table of contents for the page.
