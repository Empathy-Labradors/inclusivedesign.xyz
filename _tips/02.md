## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- Use the High Contrast display mode of your computer.
  - **Windows:** Use High Contrast mode. bit.ly/emplab020. Press `left Alt + left Shift + Print Screen`, or: Ease of Access button on the sign-in screen > High Contrast.
  - **Mac OS:** System Preferences > Accessibility > Display. Select Invert Colours or Use Grayscale.
- Use Lea Verou’s Contrast Ratio Checker [bit.ly/emplab047](//bit.ly/emplab047).

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Is all text still visible and readable?
- What is the contrast ratio of your site’s colours?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use a larger font size for higher contrast of text foreground and background colours.
- Make sure text has good foreground/background contrast. See bit.ly/emplab032 . A ratio of 4.5:1 gives you WCAG AA compliance ("you're doing great for Web Content Accessibility") and 7:1 for WCAG AAA compliance ("you're doing amazing for Web Content Accessibility!")
- Don’t use colour alone to convey information. Use additional things like font weight, borders, icons and help text too.
