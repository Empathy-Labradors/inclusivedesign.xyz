## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- **Chrome:** start Color Carl in {% include link id=3 %}.
  - Activate the red/green filter.
- **iOS and Mac OS:** run {% include link id=9 %}.
Menu → set colour to deuteranopia
  - Browse your site.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- How does your site look?
- Can you easily read your menus, text, calls to action?
- How does your logo look? What about your main calls to action?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Find a new colour palette.
- Improve colours on your site to be more readable for colourblind users.
- Make sure text has good foreground/background contrast. See {% include link id=4 %}. A ratio of 4.5:1 gives you WCAG AA compliance ("you're doing great for Web Content Accessibility") and 7:1 for WCAG AAA compliance ("you're doing amazing for Web Content Accessibility!")
- Don’t use colour alone to convey information (e.g. error or success messages). Use additional things like font weight, borders, icons and help text too.
