title: Magnify all the things
why: People with visual impairments use magnifiers to read on-screen content. While the content inside the magnifier is readable for them, the other information on the page could be out of focus.

## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- **Windows:** press the Windows key‌  and + (plus sign). Or  Start > Settings > Ease of Access > Magnifier, and then move the slider under Magnifier to turn it on > browse your site (See bit.ly/emplab001)
- **Mac OS:** System Preferences > Zoom > check "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom" > select "Zoom style: Picture-in-picture" > toggle zoom using the defined shortcuts (default is ⌥⌘8) > browse your site.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- Is there content or functionality (e.g. flyouts, drop down menus, tooltip, hover effects) that is no longer visible or accessible?
- Is user feedback contextual and in the right place? (E.g. do validation or error messages sit next to their form fields?)

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Make sure that tooltips and help/error messages display close to the elements or fields that they belong to: if information belongs together, show it together!
- Use consistent layout and design patterns throughout your site. 
- Avoid visual clutter, including unnecessary animations or transitions and reduce distractions on the page.
