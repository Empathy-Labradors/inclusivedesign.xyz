## What to do
{: .tip-what }

- Start **Blurry Bianca** in the Funkify extension: see [bit.ly/emplab019](//bit.ly/emplab019)
- Set “Intensity of simulation” to about 2 out of 10.

## Things to check
{: .tip-check }

- How does your site look?
- Can you still read your menus, calls to action and text?

## Things you could change
{: .tip-change}

- Use a bigger base `font-size`. `100%` is a good minimum.
- Use text that users can adjust (e.g. let users change text size and colour).
Don’t have lots of text embedded inside images: rather use text with the image as a background.
- Make sure text has good foreground/background contrast. See [bit.ly/emplab032](//bit.ly/emplab032) . A ratio of 4.5:1 gives you WCAG AA compliance ("you're doing great for Web Content Accessibility") and 7:1 for WCAG AAA compliance ("you're doing amazing for Web Content Accessibility!")
